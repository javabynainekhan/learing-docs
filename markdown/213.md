# ReactJS Notes (Updated: 21-April-2025)

---

## 1. Introduction to React

### What is React?

React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, especially for web applications.

### Features of React

* Component-based architecture
* JSX
* Virtual DOM
* One-way data binding
* Reusability

### Limitations of React

* Rapid pace of development
* Poor documentation (for beginners)
* SEO limitations (without SSR)
* JSX complexity for new devs
* Boilerplate for large-scale apps

---

## 2. JSX, DOM, Virtual DOM

### What is JSX?

JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It allows writing HTML-like syntax in JavaScript. JSX must be compiled with Babel before it runs in browsers.

### What is DOM?

DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface that represents the structure of a webpage as a tree of objects.

### What is Virtual DOM?

Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM used to optimize UI rendering in React.

---

## 3. Components

### Class vs Functional Components

| Feature           | Class Components                       | Functional Components                     |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Syntax            | `class MyComp extends React.Component` | `function MyComp() {}` or arrow functions |
| State             | Uses `this.state`                      | Uses `useState()`                         |
| Lifecycle Methods | Yes (e.g., `componentDidMount`)        | Replaced by hooks like `useEffect()`      |
| Performance       | Slightly heavier                       | Generally lighter & faster                |

---

## 4. State, Props, and Data Flow

### What is State?

State is a JavaScript object used to store dynamic data in a component. Updating state triggers re-renders.

### What is useState()?

A hook used to add state to functional components. It returns a state variable and a function to update it.

```js
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

### What are Props?

Props are immutable data passed from parent to child components.

### State vs Props

| Feature    | State                       | Props                        |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Mutability | Mutable                     | Immutable                    |
| Ownership  | Maintained within component | Passed from parent           |
| Usage      | For local component data    | For configuration/data input |

---

## 5. Prop Drilling & Context

### What is Prop Drilling?

Passing data through many nested components even if intermediate ones don’t need it.

### Disadvantages & Alternatives:

* Difficult to maintain and debug
* Can lead to performance issues
* Use **Context API**, **Redux**, or **Zustand** instead

### What is React Context?

React Context allows global state sharing without prop drilling.

---

## 6. Lifecycle Methods (Class Components)

| Lifecycle Phase | Method                                    |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Mounting        | constructor, render, componentDidMount    |
| Updating        | shouldComponentUpdate, componentDidUpdate |
| Unmounting      | componentWillUnmount                      |

---

## 7. Hooks

### Common Hooks

* `useState` – add state
* `useEffect` – side effects
* `useRef` – DOM references
* `useMemo` – memoized value
* `useCallback` – memoized function
* `useReducer` – complex state logic

### useEffect replaces:

* `componentDidMount`
* `componentDidUpdate`
* `componentWillUnmount`

---

## 8. Advanced Hooks

### useMemo vs useCallback

| Feature | useMemo              | useCallback                   |
| ------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Returns | Memoized value       | Memoized function             |
| Usage   | Avoid recalculations | Prevent function re-creations |
| Syntax  |                      |                               |

```js
const memoValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
const memoFn = useCallback(() => doSomething(a), [a]);
```

### useReducer

Used for complex state logic or alternative to `useState`. Returns `[state, dispatch]`.

### Custom Hooks

Functions starting with `use` that reuse logic between components.

---

## 9. React Concepts

### Pure Components

Only re-render when state/props change (Shallow comparison).

### Fragments

Return multiple elements without an extra DOM node:

```jsx
<>
  <h1>Hello</h1>
  <p>World</p>
</>
```

### Higher-Order Components (HOC)

Functions that accept a component and return a new component:

```js
const EnhancedComponent = withAuth(MyComponent);
```

### Portals

Render children outside the DOM hierarchy:

```jsx
ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container);
```

---

## 10. Error Handling

### Error Boundaries

Catch JS errors in the component tree and display fallback UI. Works in class components or with libraries like Sentry for function components.

---

## 11. Forms

### Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components

| Feature     | Controlled                               | Uncontrolled               |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Data Source | React state                              | DOM                        |
| Example     | `<input value={value} onChange={...} />` | `<input ref={inputRef} />` |

---

## 12. Refs and Forward Refs

* `useRef()` allows access to DOM nodes
* `forwardRef()` allows refs to be passed to child components

---

## 13. Synthetic Events

React’s wrapper around browser events to ensure consistency across browsers.

---

## 14. Strict Mode

Development tool to detect unsafe lifecycle methods, legacy API usage, and unexpected side effects.

---

## 15. Reconciliation & Diffing Algorithm

Compares previous and current virtual DOM trees and updates only the parts that changed.

---

## 16. Render Props Pattern

A pattern where a component’s child is a function that returns a React element.

---

## 17. `createElement` vs `cloneElement`

| Function          | Purpose                                 |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `createElement()` | Create new React element                |
| `cloneElement()`  | Clone and modify existing React element |

---

## 18. React Router

### Protected Routes

Only accessible after authentication.

### Redirects

Use `useNavigate()` after login:

```js
const navigate = useNavigate();
useEffect(() => navigate("/dashboard"), []);
```

### Passing Data Between Siblings

Lift state up to a parent and pass data via props.

---

## 19. Exports

### `export default` vs `export`

| Feature | `export default` | `export` (named) |
| ------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Number  | One per file     | Many             |
| Import  | No braces        | Use braces       |
| Alias   | Can rename       | Use `as`         |

---

## 20. Performance Optimization

### Techniques

* `React.memo`
* `useMemo`, `useCallback`
* Lazy loading with `React.lazy()`
* List virtualization (e.g., `react-window`)
* Debouncing input changes
* Avoid anonymous functions in render

---

## 21. Lazy Loading

Only loads components when needed using `React.lazy()` and `<Suspense>`.

---

## 22. Keys in React

Unique identifiers for list items to help React optimize re-rendering.

---

## 23. Hooks vs Classes Performance

Hooks:

* Less boilerplate
* Better performance optimization

---

## 24. API Consumption

Use `fetch()` or `axios` inside `useEffect` to call REST APIs.

---

## 25. Context API vs Redux

| Feature       | Context API         | Redux                |
| ------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| Built-in      | Yes                 | No                   |
| Use case      | Simple global state | Complex/global state |
| Async support | Basic               | Strong (middleware)  |

---

## 26. Child to Parent Data Flow

* Callback functions
* Lifting state
* Context/Redux

---

| Speed           | Slow initial load | Faster first load |
| SEO             | Poor              | Better            |

---

## 28. `package.json` vs `package-lock.json`

| File                | Purpose                          |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `package.json`      | Declares dependencies & metadata |
| `package-lock.json` | Locks exact dependency versions  |

---

## 29. React Fiber

A complete rewrite of the React core algorithm that enables features like async rendering, prioritization, and smoother UI updates.

---

## 30. Lifting State Up

Move shared state to the nearest common ancestor component.

---

## 31. TypeScript in React

Statically typed superset of JS. Works with hooks.

```tsx
const [count, setCount] = useState<number>(0);
```

---

## 32. Common React Design Patterns

* **Container/Presentational**
* **HOC**
* **Render Props**
* **Custom Hooks**
* **Compound Components**

---

## 33. Browser Resize Listener

```tsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function ResizeComponent() {
  const [width, setWidth] = useState(window.innerWidth);

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => setWidth(window.innerWidth);
    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
  }, []);

  return <p>Window width: {width}px</p>;
}
```

---

## 34. Pure Components vs Normal Components

| Feature     | Pure Component             | Normal Component        |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Re-renders  | Only if props/state change | Always on parent update |
| Performance | Optimized                  | Not                     |
Certainly! Continuing from where we left off:

---

## 34. Pure Components vs Normal Components (continued)

| Feature        | Pure Component                                              | Normal Component                            |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Performance    | Optimized for performance                                   | Less optimized                              |
| Usage          | Use when component renders same output for same props/state | Use for general cases                       |
| Syntax (Class) | `class MyComponent extends React.PureComponent`             | `class MyComponent extends React.Component` |

---

## 35. Redux Architecture (Brief Overview)

Redux follows a **unidirectional data flow**:

1. **Store**

   * Centralized state of the entire app.

2. **Actions**

   * JavaScript objects describing what happened (type + payload).

3. **Reducers**

   * Pure functions that take state and action, return new state.

4. **Dispatch**

   * Method used to send actions to the store.

5. **Selectors**

   * Functions to select parts of the state for use in components.

### Redux Flow Diagram:

```
Component -> dispatch(action) 
          -> reducer updates store 
          -> store notifies subscribers 
          -> Component re-renders
```

### Example:

```js
// action
const increment = () => ({ type: 'INCREMENT' });

// reducer
function counterReducer(state = 0, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT': return state + 1;
    default: return state;
  }
}

// store
const store = createStore(counterReducer);
```

===========================================================================================================================================================================================================
1.What is React?
Ans:
	React is a JS Library, it is used for building User Interfaces, primarily for web applications.

2.What are the features of React?
Ans:
React has several core features they are : 
Component-based architecture
JSX
Virtual-DOM
One-Way Data Binding
Reusability

3.What are the limitations of React?
Ans:


4.What is JSX?
Ans:
	JSX is a JavaScript XML extension that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. JSX won’t be executed directly in the browser; it must first be compiled into JavaScript files with the help of Babel.

5.What is DOM?
Ans: 
	DOM stands for Document Object Model. It represents a webpage as a tree of objects, it allows dynamically access and manipulate the content, structure and style of the page.

6.What is Virtual DOM ?
Ans:
	Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of real DOM.

7.What are the differences between class components and functional components?










	
1.What is the state in ReactJS?
Ans:
State is a JavaScript object that holds data that can change over time and influence the component to render once. It acts as a component's memory, enabling it to remember information between renders. 
	
2.What is useState() in React?
 Ans : 	
	In React, useState is a hook, it lets you add a state to the functional components.
It returns an array with two values one is to hold the data and another is to update that.	

3.What are props in React?
Ans: 
	Props stands for properties, passing data from parent to child component, props are immutable, we can pass anything such as component, states, functions.

4.What are the differences between state and props in React?
Ans:
	
5.What is props drilling?
Ans:
	 "Prop drilling" refers to passing data (props) from a parent component to a deeply nested child component through multiple layers of intermediate components, even if those intermediate components don't directly use the data.

6.What are the disadvantages of props drilling and how can we avoid props drilling?
Ans:
	Prop drilling can lead to code that is harder to maintain, debug, and understand, as well as potential performance issues. To avoid this, consider using React Context, Redux and Zustand etc,,

7.What is the context in React?	
Ans:
	Context is a way to pass data through a component tree without having to pass props down through every level. It helps avoid prop drilling.

Or

React Context lets us create global variables that can be accessed by any component, it helps to avoid prop drilling and making data sharing easier.

8.What are Pure Components in React?
Ans:
	PureComponent is similar to Component but it skips re-renders for same props and state. This means when that it must return same output when it’s props and state haven’t changed.

9.What is the component lifecycle of React class components?

10.What are fragments in React?
Ans:
	Fragments are a way to group or return multiple elements within a component without introducing an extra node to the DOM.

11.What are Higher-Order Components (HOC) in React?
Ans:
	HOC is a function that takes the another function as input and returns a new enhanced component, allowing yout to use reuse component logic across multiple components without modifying them directly.

12.What are Portals in React?
 Portals in React provide a way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.

✅ Why Use Portals?
Normally, React components render inside their parent container. But sometimes, you need to break out of that structure — for example:
Modals / Popups
Tooltips
Dropdowns
Overlays
These UI elements often need to appear above all other content, and not be constrained by CSS or layout of parent components.





1. What are hooks in React?
Ans: 
In React, hooks are special functions that allow you to use state and life cycle features in functional components. They were introduced in React 16.8 to give functional components the same capabilities as class components.

Hook Rules:
There are 3 rules for hooks:
Hooks can only be called inside React function components.
Hooks can only be called at the top level of a component.
Hooks cannot be conditional
2.What are the different hooks you have used?
Ans: In React, several types of hooks are there
State Hooks
Effect Hooks
Ref Hooks
Context Hooks
Performance Hooks
	
3. What is useEffect?
Ans:
	In React, useEffect is a hook that allows you to perform side effects in functional components, such as fetching data, subscribing to events, or directly manipulating the DOM, after a component renders.
	

4.Which lifecycle hooks in class components are replaced with useEffect in functional components?
Ans:
	The useEffect hook serves as a replacement for the lifecycle methods componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount.
	
5. Explain the types of side effects in a React component.
Ans:
	 We usually deal with two types. One is non-visual side effects like API calls, subscriptions, or timers. The other is visual side effects like manually modifying the DOM. React handles all of these inside useEffect to ensure they’re managed safely. 



6. What is useMemo?
Ans: 
	The useMemo hook is to memorize the value. preventing unnecessary recalculations when dependencies haven’t changed. It improves performance.

7.What is useCallback?
Ans:
	useCallback is a hook, it memorizes a function. Ensuring that function recreates only one of its dependencies changes.

8.What are the differences between useMemo and useCallback?
Ans:
useMemo:
Used to memoize a value (the result of a computation).
It helps avoid recalculating expensive values on every render unless their dependencies change.
useCallback:
Used to memoize a function so that it doesn’t get recreated on every render unless its dependencies change.
This helps to prevent unnecessary re-creations of functions, which can prevent child component re-renders when the function is passed as a prop.
9. When to use useState and useReducer, differences?
Ans:
	

10.What is the useReducer hook?

11.What are custom hooks?
Ans:
	A Custom Hook is a JavaScript function that lets you reuse logic across multiple components.
Custom hooks are JavaScript functions that encapsulate reusable logic and allow you to share stateful logic between components, starting with the "use" prefix, and can call other hooks.
For example, I’ve created a custom hook to track window dimensions or check network connectivity in React Native.




	
 					REACT ADVANCED CONCEPTS

1.What are Error Boundaries?
Ans:
In React, an error boundary is a component that catches JavaScript errors anywhere in its child component tree, logs those errors, and displays a fallback UI instead of showing a blank screen.

Error boundaries catch JavaScript errors in child components and show a fallback UI. They're only available in class components, but we can still wrap our function components inside one.

While error boundaries are traditionally implemented with class components, they can be achieved with functional components using React Hooks. 

The useErrorHandler hook and useEffect hook can be used to capture and handle errors in functional components, allowing for similar error boundary behavior. 
Third-party packages like react-use-error-boundary and Sentry.ErrorBoundary also provide functionalities for creating error boundaries in functional components. 


2.What is the purpose of the callback function as an argument of setState()?
Ans: 
The setState callback function is a powerful feature in React that allows developers to execute code after the state has been updated and the component has re-rendered. This ensures that any actions that depend on the new state are executed at the correct time.

It's executed after the state is updated and the component has re-rendered. Useful for triggering actions after the update.

setCount(prev => prev + 1, () => {
  console.log("Updated!");
});
setCount(prev => prev + 1, () => {
  console.log("Updated!");
});
setCount(prev => prev + 1, () => {
  console.log("Updated!");
});  // count=0





3.What are the differences between controlled and uncontrolled components?
Ans:

In React, controlled components manage their form data through React's state, while uncontrolled components handle their data using the DOM itself - Madan


Controlled: State is handled by React (useState)


Uncontrolled: Managed by the DOM via ref

<input value={value} onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} />

// Uncontrolled
<input ref={inputRef} />



4.What are Ref’s in React?
Ans:
In React, a Ref (short for reference) is used to directly access and interact with a DOM element or a React component instance.

5.What is meant by forward ref?
Ans:
In React, forwardRef is a utility function that allows you to pass a ref from a parent component to a child component, specifically when you need to access the underlying DOM node of a child component from the parent. This is useful when you want to interact with a child component's DOM element directly, such as focusing it or measuring its dimensions.
React 19 eliminates the need for forwardRef by allowing ref to be passed directly as a prop to functional components, just like any other prop.
import { forwardRef, useRef } from 'react';
// Child component (CustomInput)
const CustomInput = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  return (
    <input
      ref={ref} // Forward the ref to the input element
      type="text"
      {...props} // Pass other props
    />
  );
});

// Parent component (App)
function App() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  const handleFocus = () => {
    inputRef.current.focus(); // Focus the input element using the ref
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <CustomInput
        ref={inputRef} // Pass the ref to the child component
        placeholder="Enter text"
      />
      <button onClick={handleFocus}>Focus Input</button>
    </div>
  );
}

6.What are synthetic events in React?
Your event handlers will be passed instances of SyntheticEvent, a cross-browser wrapper around the browser’s native event. It has the same interface as the browser’s native event, including stopPropagation() and preventDefault(), except the events work identically across all browsers.
Or 
In React, synthetic events are cross-browser wrappers around native browser events, providing a consistent event handling system. They ensure that events work identically across all browsers, simplifying development and eliminating inconsistencies that can arise from browser differences. React creates these synthetic events and attaches them to DOM elements to handle user interactions like clicks and key presse

In React, Synthetic Events are wrapper objects around the browser’s native events.
React creates its own event system to make events work the same way across all browsers, and that's what we call Synthetic Events.
Synthetic events wrap the native DOM events.
They work consistently across different browsers.
They are pooled for performance – reused across events (in older React versions).
Have the same interface as browser events (like e.preventDefault(), e.stopPropagation()).

7.What is the Strict Mode in React?
In React, Strict Mode is a development-only tool that helps identify potential problems in your application by activating additional checks and warnings, like re-rendering components and re-running effects, without affecting the final UI and it will detect the language. 
In React, Strict Mode is a tool that helps you find potential problems in your application during development. It's only for catching issues early during development.

8.What is reconciliation in ReactJS? (Diffing Algorithm)
Reconciliation is the process React uses to update the DOM efficiently when state or props change. It compares the new virtual DOM with the old virtual DOM  and updates only what’s changed.
Example:-
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
9.What are render props in React?
Render props is a pattern in React where a component takes function as a prop to decide what to render.
function MouseTracker({ render }) {
  const [position, setPosition] = React.useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });
  const handleMouseMove = e => {
    setPosition({ x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY });
  };
  return (
    <div onMouseMove={handleMouseMove}>
      {render(position)}
    </div>
  );
}
<MouseTracker render={({ x, y }) => (
  <h1>Mouse position: {x}, {y}</h1>
)} />

10.What are the differences between createElement vs cloneElement in React?
The main difference between createElement and cloneElement is that createElement is used to create a new React element, while cloneElement is used to modify an existing React element.
const element = React.createElement('h1', { className: 'title' }, 'Hello');
const original = <Button color="blue" />;
const cloned = React.cloneElement(original, { color: 'red' });










REACT NAVIGATION:=

11.What are protected routes in React?
In React applications, protected routes are specific pages or sections that are only accessible to authenticated users, ensuring that unauthorized users cannot access sensitive information or functionality
12.How do you perform automatic redirects after login?
we can use the React Router DOM useNavigate hook. Inside the component or the function that handles successful switching to one page to another page that’s why we are using the useNavigate hook. 
13.How to pass data between sibling components using React Router?
To pass data between sibling components in React using React Router, you'll typically use a common parent component and props. The parent holds the state and passes it down to its children. When a child needs to update the state, it calls a function (passed as a prop from the parent) to modify the state, which then propagates the change to the other sibling. 

In React, React Router itself doesn't directly pass data between sibling components, but you can use a few common methods alongside React Router to share data between sibling components.
function Parent() {
  const [sharedData, setSharedData] = useState("Hello");
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<SiblingA setData={setSharedData} />} />
        <Route path="/b" element={<SiblingB data={sharedData} />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

14.What is the difference between export default and export in React JS?
Ans:
🔹 export default
✅ You can have only one default export per file.
✅ Import without curly braces.
✅ You can rename it during import.
🔹 export (Named Export)
✅ You can have multiple named exports in one file.
✅ Import with curly braces.
🚫 Must match the exact name unless using as to alias.

export default is used to export a single value or component from a file, and it can be imported with any name. export (named export) allows you to export multiple values, and you must import them using their exact names. In React, export default is commonly used for exporting components, while named exports are useful for utility functions or constants
15.What react-router has a context menu?
Ans:
React Router itself does not provide a built-in context menu, but you can create a custom context menu and use React Router to navigate from that menu.

✅ What you can do:
You can use:
React's context menu events (onContextMenu)


Custom context menu components


And integrate React Router's useNavigate to navigate when an option is clicked.

1. How do you optimize react applications ?
Ans: 
	Optimizing a React app means making it faster and smoother. You can do this by using React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback to avoid unnecessary work, splitting code to load only what’s needed, cleaning up effects, removing console logs and using production build for better performance.


2. How to prevent re-renders in react ?
Ans:
To prevent unnecessary re-renders in React, I use React.memo for functional components, useCallback to memoize functions, and useMemo to memoize expensive calculations. I also avoid creating new objects or functions inside JSX and make sure state updates only when needed.

3.What is Lazy Loading in React ?
Ans: 
Lazy loading in React means loading components only when they are needed, rather than at the initial load. It helps reduce the initial bundle size and improves performance

Syntax:=
Import  { lazy } from ‘react’
const MarkdownPreview = lazy(() => import('./MarkdownPreview.js'));

4.what are keys in react ?
Ans: 
In React Keys are unique identifiers. They help React to identify which items have changed, been added, or removed, making list rendering faster and more efficient.
Why it's important:
Without keys, React may re-render the entire list unnecessarily, causing performance issues or bugs.


5.How does the performance of using hooks differ in comparison with classes?
Ans: 
Hooks generally offer better performance and cleaner code compared to class components. They reduce the amount of boilerplate, avoid binding issues, and make it easier to reuse logic using custom hooks. Also, React can optimize functional components better, especially when using React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback.

6.Name a few techniques to optimize React app performance.
Ans:		
A few techniques to optimize React app performance include:
Using React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
Using useMemo and useCallback for memoization
Code splitting with React.lazy and Suspens
Virtualizing long lists with react-window
Avoiding anonymous functions in JSX
Cleaning up side effects in useEffect

7.How would you consume a RESTful JSON API in ReactJS?
Ans:
To consume a RESTful JSON API in ReactJS, I use the fetch API or axios inside the useEffect hook. I store the response data in state using useState and handle loading and error states for a smooth user experience.

8.what is Context API vs Redux?
Ans:
Context API is a built-in React feature for state management. It's great for passing data down the component tree without having to prop-drill, but it's ideal for smaller apps or less complex state management.
Redux is a more powerful, external library for managing global state, providing tools for handling complex state logic, middleware (like for async actions), and performance optimizations. It’s more suitable for large-scale apps with complicated state logic.

9.What are the different ways to pass data from child component to parent component in React?

Ans:

In React, the main way to pass data from a child to a parent is by using a callback function. The parent passes a function to the child as a prop, and the child calls that function with the data.


1. Callback Functions:
The parent component defines a function that will handle the data from the child. 


This function is passed down to the child component as a prop. 


The child component invokes this function when it needs to send data to the parent, passing the data as an argument.


The parent component's function then receives the data and can update its state or perform other actions.
2. Lifting State Up:
If the data shared between child and parent components is a state, the state can be moved to their closest common parent component.
The parent component then passes the state and functions to update the state down to the child components as props.
This approach centralizes state management and ensures a single source of truth.
3. Third-Party Libraries (Redux, Context API):
For more complex applications with deeply nested components, state management libraries like Redux or React's built-in Context API can be used.
These tools allow components to access shared data without passing props down through multiple levels of the component tree.

// Parent Component
function Parent() {
  const handleData = (childData) => {
    console.log('Data from child:', childData);
  };

  return <Child sendData={handleData} />;
}

// Child Component
function Child({ sendData }) {
  return (
    <button onClick={() => sendData('Hello from Child')}>
      Send Data
    </button>
  );
}


8.What are the differences between client-side and server-side rendering?
Ans:	
Client-side rendering (CSR) means the browser loads a blank page and uses JavaScript to show content.
Server-side rendering (SSR) means the server sends a ready-made HTML page to the browser.

9.What are the differences between package.json and package-lock.json?
Ans:
package.json defines the project's metadata, including dependencies and their version ranges, while package-lock.json  locks the exact versions of those dependencies to make sure different environments installs the same versions. 

10.What is React Fiber?
Ans:
React Fiber is the core algorithm behind React that was introduced in version 16. It improves rendering performance by allowing asynchronous and incremental rendering. This means React can split rendering work into smaller chunks and prioritize more important updates first, which helps build smoother and more responsive UIs.


11.What is lifting state up in React?
Lifting state up means moving state from a child component to its parent so that the parent can control and share that state with other child components



12.What are React Mixins? - Deprecated


13.Does React Hook work with static typing?
Ans:

Yes! React Hooks work perfectly with static typing, especially when using TypeScript.

import { useState } from 'react';
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState<number>(0); // 👈 Static typing with TypeScript
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Count: {count}</button>;
};


Q. What is typescript ?
Ans:
	TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a superset of JavaScript, TypeScript adds optional static typing, interfaces, enums, and other features to JavaScript.

Uses:
It allows developers to catch errors during development rather than at runtime.
Improve the quality and maintainability of code, especially in large projects.



14.Different design patterns used in React?

There are several design patterns used in React to organize and reuse code effectively. Some common ones are:
 Examples of React Design Patterns:
Container and Presentational – separates logic and UI


Higher-Order Components (HOC) – adds extra functionality to components


Render Props – shares code using a function as a prop


Custom Hooks – reuses logic with hooks


Compound Components – multiple components working together using shared state


15.How to re-render the view when the browser is resized?
Ans:

To re-render the view on browser resize, you can use the useEffect hook to listen for the resize event and update a state. When the state changes, React re-renders the component.






import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
function ResizeComponent() {
  const [width, setWidth] = useState(window.innerWidth);
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => setWidth(window.innerWidth);
    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize); // cleanup
  }, []);
  return <p>Window width: {width}px</p>;
}

To re-render a React component when the browser is resized, You'll need to add a resize event listener to the window and update the component's state or props when the resize event is triggered.  - Madan


16.What is the difference between Pure Components and normal components?
Ans:


A Pure Component in React automatically avoids re-rendering if the props and state haven’t changed.
 A Normal Component always re-renders when its parent re-renders, even if props didn’t change.
